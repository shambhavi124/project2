Smart Parking System | IoT-Based Parking Slot Detection
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an IoT-based Smart Parking System designed to monitor real-time parking slot availability using ultrasonic sensors and the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller. The system reduces traffic congestion and improves user convenience by automatically detecting whether a parking slot is occupied or free and displaying the status through LEDs and a mobile application.

📌 Features

Real-time parking slot detection using ultrasonic sensors

Automatic indication of slot availability via LEDs

IoT integration using NodeMCU ESP8266 for wireless data transmission

Mobile monitoring through the Blynk IoT application

Efficient space utilization and reduced search time

Reliable hardware-software communication system

📌 Problem Statement

Traditional parking systems lack real-time availability information, causing traffic congestion, time wastage, and inefficient parking management. This project addresses these challenges by implementing an automated system that accurately detects and shares parking slot status in real time.

📌 Project Objective

To design and develop an intelligent IoT-enabled Smart Parking System that automates slot detection, displays accurate availability, and provides real-time updates to users through a mobile application.

📌 Hardware Components

NodeMCU ESP8266

Ultrasonic Sensors

LEDs

Resistors

Breadboard & Connecting Wires

📌 Software/Tools Used

Arduino IDE

Blynk IoT App

Embedded C / Arduino Code

Wi-Fi Communication

📌 Working Principle

The ultrasonic sensors continuously measure the distance between the sensor and any object in the parking slot. Based on the distance value, the system identifies if a vehicle is present. This data is transmitted through the ESP8266 microcontroller to the Blynk cloud, where users can view the live status of each slot.

📌 Key Outcomes

Automated and efficient parking management

Reduced vehicle search time

Better space utilization

Easy monitoring through mobile devices
